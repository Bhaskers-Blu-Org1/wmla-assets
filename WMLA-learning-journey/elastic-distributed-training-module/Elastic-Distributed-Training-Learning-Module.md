## Summary
Watson Machine Learning Accelerator Elastic Distributed Training (EDT) transforms static monolithic training into a dynamic process that is resilient to failures and automatically scales GPU allocation while training.   The model distribution is transparent to the end user, without coding the topology of the distribution.    EDT dynamically allocates GPUs across multiple running job without any job termination.   EDT enables multiple Data Scientists sharing GPUs in dynamic fashion, driving data scientists productivity while driving overall GPU utilization.
