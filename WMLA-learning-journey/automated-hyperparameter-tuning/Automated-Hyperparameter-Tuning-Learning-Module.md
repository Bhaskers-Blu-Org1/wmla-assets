## Instructions

The detailed steps for this tutorial can be found in the associated xx.  

Learn how to:

- Make changes to your code
- Make your dataset available
- Set up API end point and log on
- Submit job via API
- Monitor running job
- Retrieve output and saved models
- Debug any issues


## Changes to your code

Note that the code sections below show a comparison between the "before" and "HPO enabled" versions of the code using `diff`.

1. Get the WMLA cluster RESULT_DIR and LOG_DIR for the hpo training job. The RESULT_DIR can be used for final model saving, and the LOG_DIR can be used for user logs and monitoring.
